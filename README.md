# 24/7 Football for Kids

## Motivation

24/7 Football for Kids is a fun, interactive application, providing kids an opportunity to search for their favorite fantasy football stars.  By first clicking on the team name, then the player name, a custom player card with image, name, team, position, height, weight, and college populates.  It is like having digital football cards for all of your favorite fantasy football players at your fingertips.

We were motivated to build 24/7 Football for Kids by a number of reasons.  Our market research showed that there are very few accessible sites and applications for kids who are just getting into football.  Sites like pro football focus (PFF), NFL.com, footballoutsiders.com, and fansided.com provide varied material and insight into the NFL.  However, they are geared towards seasoned fantasy football managers, gamblers, and statheads.  Additionally, it is well-documented that the NFL has a heightened concern regarding the potential drop in youth involvement in football due to concussion research and subsequent fear of allowing childern to play football.  

Acknowledging the NFL's lack of kid-friendly web content and its need to keep its pipeline of fans and players open and healthy, we set out to build a fun, interactive application for kids to introduce themselves to the NFL and its players.  24-7 Football for Kids is an opportunity for your child to find their favorite player card in two clicks.

## What did we learn?

We learned that NFL APIs are difficult to access.  We concluded that NFL APIs are protected and expensive because betting on the NFL is such an enormous industry.   An estimated $100 billion was wagered at licensed sportsbooks during the 2019 NFL season, with billions wagered on the Super Bowl LV alone in the US.  The information and statistics accessible through APIs create a potential edge for the bettor, giving the information a definitive monetary value.  

We also learned that linking the different technologies taught in our bootcamp course can be challenging and time consuming.  

Finally, we have learned that through intentional communication and recap, many of the challenges from our first two projects have been corrected or avoided, giving all of us a tremendous sense of accomplishment.
